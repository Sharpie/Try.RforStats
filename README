REQUIREMENTS
----------

These are the main components:

* A JSON service provided by a FastCGI process haskell-jsonrpc
   <http://github.com/chrisdone/haskell-jsonrpc>
* Which in turn uses a patched (mutilated) version of mueval
   <http://github.com/chrisdone/mueval-interactive>
* It also includes the graphics-raphael micro-project just for
  providing simple Raphael features to the learner
   <http://github.com/chrisdone/graphics-raphael>

A web server. FastCGI support. PHP support.

OTHER (INCLUDED) COMPONENTS
------------------------

* For the JavaScript interactive console it uses jquery.console.js
   <http://github.com/chrisdone/jquery-console>

STEPS TO GET RUNNING
--------------------

Download and build the patched mueval. Might not necessarily have to
install it.

Download and build haskell-jsonrpc, edit the file to set any paths
(should only be one) to your mueval-core location.

Install graphics-raphael.

I used lighttpd, so I don't know about other HTTP servers, here is my
lighttpd configuration:

$HTTP["host"] =~ "tryhaskell" {
    server.document-root       = "/home/chris/Projects/Kiboki/wwwroot/haskell/tryhaskell"
    url.rewrite-once = ( "haskell-eval\.json(.*)$" => "haskell-json.fcgi$1" )
    # haskell json evaluator
    fastcgi.server = ("haskell-json.fcgi" =>
      ("localhost" =>
        ("socket" => "/home/chris/Projects/Kiboki/haskell/haskell-json/httpd/haskell-json.sock",
         "bin-path" => "/home/chris/Projects/Kiboki/haskell/haskell-json/dist/build/haskell-json.fcgi/haskell-json.fcgi",
         "max-procs" => 4,
         "docroot" => "/home/chris/Projects/Kiboki/haskell/haskell-json")))
}

The main functionality/central process is provided by
js/tryhaskell.js. Have a look at the `pages` variable, those are the
lessons.

You should be able to make your own tutorials from this project. Feel
free to change the look and feel completely and visual creditation on
the page is not necessary.
